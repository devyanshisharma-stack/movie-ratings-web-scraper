Overview:

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline to collect, process, and analyze movie ratings and user reviews from the web.
The system scrapes multi-page datasets, structures user–movie interactions, and applies user-based collaborative filtering
using cosine similarity to generate personalized movie recommendations. Techniques used in this project mirror those found
in real-world recommendation systems used by streaming platforms and personalized digital products.
